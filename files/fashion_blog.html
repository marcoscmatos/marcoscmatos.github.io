      If you´re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
      But I wasn´t solucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you
      outr. Firsst, plan out wich shows are most important to you and make a
      schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you´re worryng about
      blowing your cash the whole time you won´t have fun. Then checl out
      prices, days and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most.
      lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!

    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

    <p>
      Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don´t you´ll be
      uncomfotable the whole time ant it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
      expresssng yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
      express throught theyir new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes
      you'll be confortable in all day Obviously you want to look good, but
      you'll be on yoour feet all day long, so be prepared.
